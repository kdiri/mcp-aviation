# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Emergency Airport Finder is a real-time aviation safety tool that helps pilots quickly identify the nearest suitable airports for emergency landings. The system considers aircraft specifications, airport runway capabilities, and current location to provide instantaneous recommendations. This tool aims to enhance flight safety by reducing the time needed to find appropriate emergency landing options during critical situations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pilot in an emergency situation, I want to instantly find the closest airports where my aircraft can safely land, so that I can make quick decisions during critical moments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pilot provides their current location (GPS coordinates, city name, or postal code) THEN the system SHALL return a ranked list of suitable airports within a reasonable range
2. WHEN the system processes a location request THEN it SHALL respond within 2 seconds to ensure real-time usability
3. WHEN multiple suitable airports are found THEN the system SHALL rank them by distance from the current location
4. IF no suitable airports are found within 100 nautical miles THEN the system SHALL expand the search radius and notify the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pilot flying different aircraft types, I want the system to only recommend airports that can accommodate my specific aircraft, so that I don't waste time considering unsuitable options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pilot specifies their aircraft type THEN the system SHALL filter airports based on runway length, width, and weight capacity requirements
2. WHEN an aircraft type is selected THEN the system SHALL validate against minimum runway specifications (e.g., A380 requires 3000m+ runway)
3. WHEN airport data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL exclude that airport from recommendations with a warning
4. IF an aircraft type is not in the database THEN the system SHALL prompt for manual runway requirements input

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want airport data to be fetched from public sources once and cached locally, so that the system remains fast and doesn't overload external APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts for the first time THEN it SHALL fetch comprehensive airport data from public APIs and store it locally
2. WHEN airport data is older than 30 days THEN the system SHALL update the data automatically
3. WHEN external API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with cached data and log the issue
4. WHEN new airport data is fetched THEN the system SHALL validate data completeness before replacing cached data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the system, I want to access the emergency airport finder through an MCP server, so that I can integrate it with LLM providers and other aviation tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is running THEN it SHALL expose airport finding functionality through standardized MCP protocol
2. WHEN an LLM queries the MCP server THEN it SHALL receive structured airport data including coordinates, runway specs, and distance
3. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THEN the MCP server SHALL handle them efficiently without blocking
4. IF the MCP server encounters an error THEN it SHALL return appropriate error codes and messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a pilot or aviation enthusiast, I want to understand how the system works and its capabilities through a blog post, so that I can trust and effectively use the tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the blog post is published THEN it SHALL explain the concept, use cases, and technical approach clearly
2. WHEN readers finish the blog post THEN they SHALL understand aircraft-airport compatibility requirements
3. WHEN the blog post describes the system THEN it SHALL include practical examples and screenshots
4. IF technical details are mentioned THEN they SHALL be explained in accessible language for non-technical readers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a pilot using the system regularly, I want the interface to be simple and fast, so that I can get emergency information without complex setup during stressful situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pilot accesses the system THEN they SHALL be able to get results with minimal input (location + aircraft type)
2. WHEN the system displays results THEN it SHALL show essential information clearly: airport name, distance, runway length, and bearing
3. WHEN results are displayed THEN they SHALL include contact information for airport operations if available
4. IF the system is used offline THEN it SHALL work with cached data and indicate the data age

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want accurate distance and bearing calculations, so that I can navigate to the recommended airport efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating distances THEN the system SHALL use great circle distance calculations for accuracy
2. WHEN displaying bearing THEN it SHALL show magnetic bearing from current position to airport
3. WHEN location is provided as city/postal code THEN the system SHALL geocode it accurately before distance calculations
4. IF GPS coordinates are provided THEN the system SHALL validate they are within reasonable aviation ranges
