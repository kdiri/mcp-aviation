# MCP Aviation Project

This project implements a system for interacting with aviation data and services using the MCP (Multi-Crew Pilot) Protocol and A2A (Application-to-Application) Protocol.

## Overview

The MCP Aviation Project aims to provide a robust and reliable interface for accessing and processing aviation-related information. This includes, but is not limited to, flight data, weather information, and airport details.

## Protocols

### MCP Protocol

The MCP Protocol is a specialized communication protocol designed for use in aviation systems. It facilitates seamless data exchange between different components of the system, ensuring data integrity and real-time communication.

### A2A Protocol

The A2A Protocol is used for application-to-application communication, enabling different software applications to interact and exchange data effectively. In this project, the A2A Protocol is utilized to connect with external aviation data providers and services.

## API Key Management

This project requires API keys to access external data providers and services. These keys are managed using a `.env` file.

- **`.env` file:** This file stores the actual API keys. It should be kept private and not be committed to the repository.
- **`.env.example` file:** (To be added) This file will serve as a template, showing the required environment variables without their actual values. Users will need to copy this file to `.env` and fill in their own API keys.
- **`load_keys.py` module:** (To be added) This Python module will be responsible for loading the API keys from the `.env` file into the application's environment.

To use the application, you will need to:
1. Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example`.
2. Add your API keys to the `.env` file.
3. The application will then use `load_keys.py` to load these keys.
