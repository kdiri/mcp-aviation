### Development Process
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Identified core data engineering challenges in aviation scenarios
2. **Architecture Design**: Modular, testable design with clear separation of concerns
3. **Iterative Development**: Built core functionality first, then added advanced features
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implemented caching, spatial indexing, and async processing
5. **AI Integration**: Added MCP server for structured AI assistant interactions
6. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and data validation frameworks

### Key Implementation Decisions
- **Async-first design** for handling concurrent emergency scenarios
- **Spatial indexing** using R-Tree for sub-second geospatial queries
- **Modular architecture** allowing easy extension and testing
- **Structured AI interfaces** through MCP rather than natural language parsing
- **Comprehensive error handling** with graceful degradation for missing data

## Challenges we ran into

### 1. Data Quality and Integration Complexity
**Challenge**: Aviation data from public sources has significant quality issues - missing runway lengths, inconsistent units (feet vs meters), duplicate entries, and irregular update frequencies.

**Solution**: Built a comprehensive data validation pipeline with:
- Automated anomaly detection for impossible runway lengths
- Unit standardization and conversion logic
- Duplicate detection and resolution algorithms
- Data freshness monitoring with configurable TTL

### 2. Real-time Performance Requirements
**Challenge**: Emergency scenarios demand sub-2-second response times, but we're processing complex geospatial calculations across 28,000+ airports with intricate compatibility rules.

**Solution**: Multi-layered performance optimization:
- R-Tree spatial indexing for fast proximity queries
- Multi-level caching with intelligent invalidation
- Async processing for parallel compatibility checking
- Query optimization and performance monitoring

### 3. Complex Business Logic Management
**Challenge**: Aircraft compatibility isn't just runway length - it involves runway width, surface type, weight capacity, approach categories, and emergency-specific exceptions.

**Solution**: Designed a flexible rule engine:
- Modular compatibility rules that can be easily extended
- Confidence scoring based on data completeness
- Graceful handling of missing or uncertain data
- Clear separation between hard requirements and warnings

### 4. AI Integration Architecture
**Challenge**: Integrating AI assistants in a way that's both powerful and reliable, avoiding the pitfalls of natural language parsing while maintaining conversational flow.

**Solution**: Implemented Model Context Protocol (MCP):
- Structured tool interfaces that AI can reason with
- Rich metadata in responses for contextual understanding
- Error handling that provides actionable feedback to AI systems
- Business intelligence integration for complex analytical queries

### 5. Balancing Realism with Educational Value
**Challenge**: Creating a system complex enough to demonstrate real data engineering challenges while keeping it accessible and clearly fictional.

**Solution**: 
- Clear disclaimers about the educational nature
- Real-world data and constraints to maintain authenticity
- Comprehensive documentation explaining design decisions
- Focus on demonstrating patterns rather than production deployment
